# Brisa 0.1.6 Release Notes

This release focuses on addressing two critical regressions introduced in the previous versions:

## Select-Option Rendering regression

We have fixed a bug that caused the select-option to render incorrectly. This issue was introduced in the previous version and has been fixed in this release.

## Hot Reload regression

We have fixed some issues related to hot-reload that caused actions conflicts during hot-reload, and hot-reload was not working as expected.
